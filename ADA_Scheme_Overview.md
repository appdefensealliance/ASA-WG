# Introduction

## 

## About the App Defense Alliance Certification Scheme

This document provides an in-depth look at the App Defense Alliance
Certification (ADA Certification) Scheme, a comprehensive security
certification program designed to elevate industry-wide security
standards.

The primary purpose of ADA Certification is to establish a unified
security assurance framework that promotes transparency and enhances
security functionality within applications. The ultimate goal of this
scheme is to drive improvements in security across the entire
application ecosystem, ensuring a safer experience for users.

Upon implementation, the ADA Certification Scheme will comprise two
primary elements:

1.  Security Evaluations: Authorized ADA Security Test Laboratories
    (ASTL) will conduct thorough security evaluations of applications.
    These evaluations will be overseen by a designated Certification
    Body (CB), which is appointed by the ADA to ensure compliance with
    the scheme's requirements, including quality and impartiality.

2.  Evaluation Criteria: Applications will be assessed against the ADA's
    Application Security Assessment (ASA) requirements. These
    requirements are developed through an open and collaborative process
    that draws from reputable industry sources, including:

    1.  The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)

    2.  The Center for Internet Security (CIS)

By leveraging these respected sources and maintaining transparency
throughout the development process, the ADA ensures that its ASA
requirements reflect the most up-to-date and effective security
standards in the industry.

## Stakeholder Benefits

The ADA Certification Scheme aims to ensure the safe handling of
confidential data by setting a baseline of requirements for
organizations that build apps that process such data and with a focus on
mobile, web, and cloud applications. The scheme serves to:

1.  **Reduce Unauthorized Access to Confidential Data**: By creating a
    prescriptive set of security best practices, ADA helps organizations
    that choose to adopt these practices to prevent data breaches and
    unauthorized access to confidential information.

2.  **Increase Trust in Application Platforms**: Sensible and consistent
    minimum security standards across application platforms builds trust
    among consumers.

3.  **Support Developers With an Ecosystem of Security Assessors**: ADA
    provides a common framework for mobile,web, and cloud security,
    allowing Developers around the world to work with qualified security
    organizations to certify their compliance with the ADA's
    requirements.

## Document Scope

This document has been produced for stakeholders to familiarize
themselves with the ADA Certification Scheme. It provides an overview of
the scheme, which enables participating Developers to demonstrate that a
particular application has achieved an industry-recognized level of
security. Applications that satisfy the evaluation criteria will receive
a public certificate that is valid for a period of time and describes
the security credentials of the application.

This document describes the most important aspects of the scheme,
including security assurance levels, the certification process and the
validity period.

## Document Maintenance

The ADA Certification Scheme documentation was created and developed by
the ADA’s Steering Committee, composed of representatives from Google,
Meta and Microsoft. This group is responsible for ongoing maintenance
and development of the ADA Certification Scheme documents and
facilitating periodic reviews involving relevant stakeholders.

# Scope of the ADA Certification

ADA Certification is specifically developed s a security assurance
scheme in the contex of the environment in which the scheme operates. In
particular::

- Mobile and web application frameworks and languages

- Secure configuration of cloud infrastructure

- Visibility of security assurance levels

- Market acceptance and participation

The certification of an application applies either to its default
configuration, provided it meets the required security standards, or to
a secure configuration process based on the developer's guidelines or
instructions.

The certification scheme does not cover user actions that can
potentially compromise the security of the application. The following
examples illustrate user behaviors that are outside the scope of this
certification:

- Compromising security credentials: Sharing passwords or other
  sensitive information with third parties, whether intentionally or
  unintentionally.

- Neglecting security updates: Failing to install security-critical
  updates in a timely manner or blocking their installation, which can
  leave the application vulnerable to known threats.

- Overriding default security settings: Intentionally or unintentionally
  granting insecure permissions to applications that were blocked by
  default in the certified configuration, thereby weakening the
  application's security posture.

- Using insecure networks: Accessing the application over high-risk
  networks, such as public Wi-Fi hotspots (e.g., airport Wi-Fi), which
  may be more susceptible to interception or eavesdropping.

- Disabling security features: Intentionally disabling built-in security
  functionality, such as password protection, which can significantly
  increase the risk of unauthorized access to the application.

# ADA Certification Scheme Overview

The ADA Certification Scheme provides a valuable opportunity for
participating developers to demonstrate their commitment to security by
achieving an industry-recognized level of security for their
applications. Here's how it works:

- Security Evaluation: Developers can submit their applications for
  evaluation at one or more security assurance levels.

- Time-Limited Certificate: Applications that pass the evaluation
  receive a time-limited certificate, which confirms compliance with the
  specified security standards.

- Security Credentials: The certificate serves as proof of the
  application's security credentials, providing transparency and
  assurance to users.

Participation in the ADA Certification Scheme is entirely voluntary,
allowing developers to choose which applications they want to undergo
security evaluation. This flexibility enables developers to prioritize
their applications' security needs and demonstrate their dedication to
delivering secure products to their users.

# ADA Certification Roles

The ADA Certification Scheme involves several key actors that work
together to ensure the scheme's success. These actors and their roles
are outlined below:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 22%" />
<col style="width: 77%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Scheme Owner</strong></th>
<th>ADA is the Scheme Owner and will own and update the scheme
requirements, assurance levels, evaluation methodology, and lab
authorization criteria.</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><strong>Certification Body (CB) / Scheme Operator</strong></th>
<th>ADA will select an ISO 17065 accredited Certification Body (CB),
sometimes referred to as the Scheme Operator. The scheme CB will
authorize and onboard independent ADA Security Test Laboratories
(ASTLs), review evaluations of developer apps submitted by the ASTLs,
issue and publish certificates, and operate the related surveillance
processes.</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><strong>ADA Security Test Laboratory (ASTL)</strong></th>
<th><p>Independent organizations who desire to perform ADA Certification
evaluations will engage with the CB to become authorized as an ASTL.
ASTLs are required to: (a) have and adhere to the ISO 17025 standard
when performing ADA Certification evaluations, and (b) demonstrate
technical proficiency in conducting ADA evaluations by successfully
passing a proficiency exam administered by the CB.</p>
<p>ASTLs submit completed app evaluations to the CB for review. ASTLs
that fail to uphold the quality standards of the ADA Certification
Scheme will lose their authorization and no longer be allowed to conduct
ADA evaluations.</p></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><strong>Application Developer</strong></th>
<th>Developers who wish to obtain an ADA Certification will select an
authorized ASTL, security assessment level, and set of ADA security
profile(s) to be evaluated against. The developer will then provide
information, evidence, and access to the ASTL, as necessary, to complete
the Lab’s evaluation. If the Developer’s application, along with
supporting information, are sufficient for the Lab to evaluate and
establish that each ADA Certification requirement is met, the lab will
prepare a passing evaluation report to the CB, which will then issue and
publish a time-limited certificate to the developer stating that the app
is ADA Certified. During the validity period, if the developer fails to
keep the app compliant with the ADA requirements, the CB will revoke the
certificate.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>

The roles and responsibilities of these actors are described in more
detail below.

## Scheme Owner 

As the Scheme Owner, ADA plays a crucial role in managing the ADA
Certification Scheme. The following sections outline ADA's
responsibilities:

### Defining Security Requirements

ADA's Application Security Assessment Working Group (ASA WG) is
responsible for defining prescriptive security requirements. These
requirements are then reviewed by ADA's Steering Committee, which
decides whether to officially release them as alliance standards. Once
released, these standards become an integral part of the ADA
Certification Scheme.

### Maintaining Scheme Documents

ADA is responsible for maintaining the Scheme documents, ensuring they
remain up-to-date and relevant.

### Key Responsibilities

As the Certification Scheme Owner, ADA's key responsibilities include:

1.  Managing Industry Group: Overseeing an industry group that maintains
    and evolves the Scheme requirements.

2.  Maintaining Scheme Documents: Ensuring that ADA Certification Scheme
    documents are accurate, up-to-date, and readily available.

3.  Market Feedback Process: Managing a market feedback process to
    gather input from stakeholders and maintain the Scheme's relevance
    and effectiveness.

4.  Appointing a Competent CB: Selecting a competent Certification Body
    (CB) and ensuring their adherence to the ADA Certification Scheme
    requirements.

By fulfilling these responsibilities, ADA ensures the overall direction
and operations of the Scheme align with its goals and objectives.

## Certification Body (CB) / Scheme Operator

The ADA Certification Scheme is designed to operate in accordance with
the provisions and expectations of ISO 17065. Certification Body (CB) is
responsible for:

- Gaining and maintaining ISO 17065 accreditation to participate and
  provide certification services for the scheme

- Identifying necessary updates to ensure ongoing alignment between ADA
  Certification and ISO 17065 expectations

- Agreeing to terms and conditions for participation in the scheme

The CB shall specifically include the ADA Certification scheme within
the scope of their ISO 17065 accreditation/certification process.

The CB is responsible for, among other things:

- Authorizing, supporting and monitoring the performance of ADA Security
  Test Labs (ASTLs)

- Ensuring ASTLs’ competence in conducting ADA evaluations and their
  adherence to the ADA Certification Scheme requirements

- Managing the ADA Certification Scheme dispute resolution process

- Certification activities, including

  - Publishing certificates

  - Maintaining an archive of historical certification data

  - Certificate lifecycle tracking (e.g., Valid, Expired, and Revoked)

The Scheme Owner’s website shall publish the primary point of contact’s
information for the ADA Certification scheme at the CB, along with
details about authorized ASTLs and ADA Certification Scheme policies and
procedures documents. The Scheme Owner is responsible for oversight of
the CB to ensure consistency across evaluations performed by the ASTLs.

## ADA Security Test Laboratory (ASTL)

ASTLs are authorized to perform application evaluations by the CB. For
laboratories to become, and stay, authorized under the scheme, they need
to:

1.  Petition to become an ASTL

2.  Begin the ISO/IEC 17025 Certification Process and successfully
    complete the process within a year of applying

3.  Demonstrate technical proficiency in conducting ADA evaluations by
    successfully passing a proficiency exam administered by the CB.

4.  Completion of the ISO/IEC 17025 Audit

*Reference the [<u>ADA Lab Authorization
document</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12qfP4tycV-iNoN34yxQ4ciQNIZ5pC5qI/edit)
for details.*

Candidate ASTLs wishing to be authorized should contact the CB and be
prepared to provide evidence of how the above requirements are met.
Organizations that successfully petition to become ASTLs will be listed
by the Scheme Owner as such under the ADA Certification Scheme.

## Application Developer

To obtain an ADA Certification for one or more applications, developers
must follow these steps and fulfill the associated responsibilities:

### Step 1: Select an Authorized Lab and Agreeing to Terms

- Choose an authorized ADA Security Test Laboratory (ASTL) to conduct
  the evaluation.

- Agree to the terms and conditions of the relevant actors, including
  non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), to participate in the Scheme.

### Step 2: Select Applications and Evaluation Scope

- Identify one or more applications to be evaluated by the ASTL.

- For each application, specify:

  - The desired security assurance level (e.g., AL0, AL1, or AL2).

  - The relevant ADA requirements profile(s) (e.g., mobile, web, cloud,
    or a combination).

### Step 3: Provide Required Information and Assistance

- Supply the ASTL with all necessary information, evidence, and access
  required for the chosen security assurance level and profile(s).

- Assist the ASTL and Certification Body in evaluating and certifying
  the application.

- Provide transparent, comprehensive, and accurate information to the
  ASTL, including:

  - Descriptions of data flows.

  - Use of external components.

  - Code samples.

  - Other relevant details.

### Ongoing Obligations for Certified Products

- If a certificate is granted, the developer must fulfill ongoing
  obligations to maintain the certification.

- Failure to meet these obligations may result in the revocation of the
  certificate.

By following these steps and fulfilling their responsibilities,
application developers can ensure a smooth and successful ADA
Certification process.

# ADA Certification Security Requirements

*Reference ADA’s security requirements on Github at
[<u>https://github.com/appdefensealliance/ASA-WG</u>](https://github.com/appdefensealliance/ASA-WG)*

# Security Assurance Levels

ADA will have 3 assurance levels that provide increasing levels of rigor
in the evaluation and therefore increasing levels of assurance that the
product does meet the ADA’s requirements.

<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>

## AL0 - Self Attestation

A Developer reviews each of the applicable ADA requirements in
comparison to their product(s) and, if the developer concludes that
their product meets every requirement, makes a fair presentation
declaration via a questionnaire (i.e., a self attestation) that their
application is compliant with the ADA requirements.

ASTLs express no opinion on whether or not the Developer does comply
with any of the ADA security standards.

## AL1 - Verified Self Assessment

A Developer performs lightweight testing, typically using publicly
available tooling, and provides evidence to an ASTL via a questionnaire.
Some developers may enlist an ASTL to conduct the lightweight testing
instead of doing it themselves. In either case, the ASTL must review the
test results.

Under AL1, the ASTL ensures that:

- The developer has provided enough contextual information about how
  their product processes confidential data to set the scope of
  applicable requirements

- The Developer has submitted sufficient evidence to evaluate whether or
  not the Developer has met each of the applicable requirements for the
  selected ADA requirements profiles

- The evidence substantiates that the developer has in fact met each of
  the applicable requirements

This level provides reasonable assurance.

## AL2 - Lab Assessment

An ASTL will verify that every security functional requirement is met.
The Developer will supply the ASTL with required information, evidence,
and access (as required) relevant to the chosen security assurance level
and profile(s). The ASTL must ensure that:

- **For requirements that can be tested**:

  - The developer’s product is conformant with the ADA requirements

- **For requirements that cannot be tested:**

  - That the developer has submitted evidence necessary to evaluate
    whether or not the Developer has met the requirement, and

  - That the evidence substantiates that the developer has met the
    requirement

This level provides the highest level of assurance.

# ADA Certification Scheme Process

The ADA Certification Scheme consists of the following phases:

1.  Preparation

2.  Submission

3.  Evaluation

4.  Certification

As there are differences between the Security Assurance Levels,
differences between the levels at the phases will be noted with ().

## Preparation Phase

During the preparation phase, the Developer:

> (ALL) Selects the application(s) for evaluation and certification
>
> (ALL) Selects the ADA requirements profile(s) desired for each
> application
>
> (ALL) Chooses one or more Security Assurance Levels
>
> (ALL) Performs the due diligence to understand their application
> architecture and flows of confidential data that are relevant for
> defining the scope of the evaluation
>
> (ALL) Identifies personnel necessary to support the evaluation such
> that transparent, comprehensive, and accurate information can be
> provided to the ASTL
>
> (ALL) Agrees to the terms and conditions of participation in the
> scheme with the Scheme Owner, ASTL and CB, as required
>
> (ALL) Submits the completed intake form
>
> (AL1/AL2) Agrees an expected evaluation duration with the ASTL
>
> (AL2) Prepares credentials (if required) for the ASTL to complete
> their evaluation (e.g read-only access to cloud accounts)

## Submission Phase

During the submission phase, the Developer organizes and submits to the
ASTL the following artifacts, as required by the Profile(s) and Security
Assurance Level being targeted:

> (ALL) the questionnaire (if applicable)
>
> (ALL) any additional evidence documentation and artifacts
>
> (ALL) any recognized security certificates relating to components
>
> (ALL) any recognized security certificates relating to the application
>
> (ALL) justifications of similarity
>
> (ALL) recognized historical certification evidence for re-use
>
> (AL2) Access credentials (if required) for the ASTL to complete their
> evaluation

## Evaluation Phase

The evaluation phase is defined in the ADA Certification Scheme security
evaluation methodology and will be applied for Application Evaluations
under the Scheme according to the Security Assurance Level applied for
by the Developer.

During the evaluation phase, the following actions occur:

> (ALL) The questionnaire is reviewed by an authorized ASTL for
> completeness and accuracy
>
> (AL1) At developer’s discretion, either the developer or ASTL conducts
> lightweight testing of the applications and the ASTL reviews the
> testing outcomes and completed Developer questionnaire
>
> (AL2) ASTL runs all security tests on the application to validate
> Developer assertions from the test questionnaire.
>
> (AL1/AL2) ASTL reviews all Developer submitted documentation for
> completeness and to verify all of the non-technically testable
> requirements
>
> (AL1/AL2) The ASTL sends requests for more information to the
> developer if required information (e.g. evidence, samples, etc.) is
> missing or insufficient for the evaluation to be completed

(AL1/AL2) During the course of the Evaluation, limited remediation work
(i.e. documentation updates, applications updates, etc.) may be carried
out by the Developer upon a requirement failure.

(ALL) Reporting of results and conclusions from Application Evaluations
shall follow the requirements defined in the scheme.

## Certification Phase

This phase includes certification Review, Decision and Attestation
processes.

If an evaluation is successful, the ASTL sends a completed Evaluation
Report to the CB. Incomplete or failed evaluations do not result in an
Evaluation Report being to the CB. Instead, the ASTL will send a notice
of the termination.

The CB conducts a review of the Evaluation Report’s results and the
evaluation procedures / testing methods.

During the CB report review, the CB works with the ASTL to resolve any
questions or comments. The ASTL can work with the CB (and if necessary
the Developer) on addressing any questions or comments (including, as
needed, additional testing). At the end of this phase, the CB will
prepare a Certification Report – which contains the result of pass,
fail, or inconclusive – and deliver it to the Developer, ASTL, and the
Scheme Owner.

Passing Certifications will be published by the Scheme Owner with a
“valid” designation.

# ADA Certification Scheme Certification Decision & Attestation

## Certification Decision 

After the ASTL completes the evaluation, it submits a technical report
to the Certification Body (CB) for review. The CB then prepares a
Certification Report, which includes a recommendation for certification.

### CB's Responsibility

The CB is solely responsible for making the certification decision,
which is documented in the Certification Report.

### Certification Decision Options

When determining whether an Application complies with the ADA
Certification Scheme security requirements, the CB's certification
decision will be one of the following:

1.  Certified: The Application meets the scheme's rules and policies,
    fulfills the security requirements, and is certified compliant.

2.  Not Certified: The Application is not compliant and is not
    certified.

### Notification of Non-Certification

If the CB decides not to certify the Application, they will identify the
reason(s) in the Certification Report and communicate it to both the
ASTL and the Developer.

### Applicability of Certification Decision

The certification decision applies to various certification processes,
including:

1.  Initial Certification: Granting certification for the first time.

2.  Scope Extension or Reduction: Extending or reducing the scope of an
    existing certification.

3.  Revocation: Revoking an existing certification.

4.  Maintenance: Maintaining an existing certification through ongoing
    evaluation and assessment.

By following this process, the CB ensures that certification decisions
are thorough, transparent, and consistent with the ADA Certification
Scheme's requirements.

## Attestation

If the CB decision is Certified, the CB shall issue an ADA Certification
Scheme certificate describing the scope of the Certification, security
assurance level, profile(s) and the validity period. This step is
dependent upon formal approval of certification by the CB, which
includes:

- The Certificate

- The Certification Report

# ADA Certification Scheme Certificate Validity Period

The maximum validity of the certification is 365 days from the date of
issue, unless there are significant changes to the application that
require an updated assessment by the Developer or otherwise invalidate
the certification. The renewal criteria for the certification will be
determined by the individual platforms that choose to rely on ADA
certificates.

## Product Changes and Evaluations

ADA specifies the following evaluations based on the level of changes
made to the app:

1.  Full: This is a complete evaluation. Completion and fulfilling a
    full evaluation will set a new expiration date of the certification
    (i.e, 365 days after the date of issuance of a certificate resulting
    from the full evaluation).

2.  Targeted: This is specifically for a patch to fix a critical
    vulnerability. This evaluation would not extend the expiration date
    of the previously-issued certification.

It's important to note that these evaluations are based on general
guidance and discretion. The Platform may require re-evaluation of the
app at any time if it determines that the app is not in compliance with
its policies or guidelines.

| **Change Type** | **Full** | **Targeted** | **No action** |
|----|----|----|----|
| New, major version of the app or change of web/cloud architecture / hosting provider | X |  |  |
| Patching a specific vulnerability reported as part of the market feedback | X | X |  |
| Minor changes such as bug fixes or minor enhancements that do not impact the app's core functionality or user experience |  |  | X |

## Renewing a Product Security Certification

When a Certificate is nearing expiration, the developer must undergo a
full re-evaluation of the application to extend its validity period.
This process is similar to the evaluation required for a major update to
the application.

## Streamlined Re-Evaluation Process

While a full re-evaluation is necessary, it's possible to reuse relevant
evidence materials from the previous evaluation. This can expedite the
re-evaluation process, making it potentially quicker than the initial
evaluation. By leveraging existing documentation and evidence,
developers can reduce the time and effort required to renew their
certification, while still ensuring that their application meets the
current security standards.

# ADA Certification Scheme Certificate Revocation

The Certification Body (CB) is responsible for managing the issuance and
revocation of certificates under the ADA Certification Scheme.

## Grounds for Revocation

The CB may revoke a certificate in the following situations:

1.  Non-Compliance with Vulnerability and Patch Management Policies: If
    a Developer fails to follow the vulnerability and patch management
    policies declared at the time of Certification for a certified
    Application.

2.  Failure to Address Exploitable Vulnerabilities: If a Developer is
    informed of exploitable vulnerabilities and fails to fix them within
    a reasonable timeframe (typically 90 days, but no more than 180
    days).

3.  Failure to Disclose Newly Discovered Vulnerabilities: If a Developer
    fails to inform the CB of newly discovered exploitable
    vulnerabilities that impact a certified Application.

4.  Deliberate Failure or Violation of Certificate Terms: If the CB
    considers the Developer's responses to be a deliberate failure or
    violation of the terms under which the Certificate was awarded.

5.  Extraordinary Situations: In severe cases, the CB and Scheme
    Operator reserve the right to revoke the certification immediately.

## Revoked Certificate Status

Once a certificate is revoked, it will be moved to the archive list by
the Scheme Owner and designated as "revoked". This ensures transparency
and accountability in the certification process.

# ADA Certification Mutual Recognition

ADA may decide to recognize certifications from other schemes as
equivalent to product certifications performed under the ADA
Certification program. Recognition may be done by the ADA at the program
level such that all certifications from the external certification
program are automatically recognized or on a per-application basis at
the request of the developer. In the future, the ADA may elect to
recognize other certificate schemes as equivalent to the ADA’s. If so,
the ADA will update these scheme documents accordingly.

The CB will manage any mutual recognition arrangement with another
program, including how to map the certificates into the ADA
Certification levels. For individual applications, the CB would
ascertain the equivalency of the program and provide a mapping for the
certificate.

# Evolution of ADA Certification Security Requirements

The ADA Certification security requirements will evolve over time to
address changing application capabilities and emerging attack vectors.
To ensure clarity and transparency, the requirements will be versioned,
and the version used in an evaluation will be clearly denoted on the
certificate.

## Transitioning to New Requirements

When new requirements are approved, they will supersede the current
requirements. To facilitate a smooth transition for Developers, ASTLs,
and consumers of certifications, a transition period will be implemented
between the old and new sets of requirements.

## Transition Period Guidelines

1.  Single Set of Requirements: Under normal circumstances, only one set
    of major release requirements is applicable for an evaluation.

2.  Dual Requirements During Transition: When a new set of requirements
    is published, a six-month transition period begins. During this
    time, evaluations can start using either the newly released or the
    next-most-recent major version of the requirements.

3.  Retirement of Old Requirements: After the transition period ends,
    the old set of requirements is retired and can no longer be used for
    new evaluations.

## Certificate Validity

The retirement of old requirements does not affect the validity period
of certificates issued using those requirements. Certificates remain
valid for their entire defined period unless revoked due to unrelated
reasons. This ensures that certified products continue to be recognized
as secure, even if the underlying requirements have changed.

# ADA Certification Scheme Post Certification Market Feedback Process

# Challenging the Validity of an ADA Certification

ADA provides a mechanism for external entities to challenge the validity
of an ADA Certification. This process allows for the review of claims or
other information relevant to the certification.

## Handling Market Feedback and Challenges

The Certification Body (CB) is responsible for documenting and handling
market feedback, including challenges to ADA Certifications. The
following steps outline the process:

Step 1: Submitting a Challenge

- A challenge is submitted to the CB with sufficient information to
  identify the ADA Certification being challenged and evidence of
  non-compliance with security claims.

- Challenges without sufficient evidence will not be reviewed, but
  additional information may be requested.

Step 2: Initial Review

- The CB conducts an initial review to determine whether the challenge
  is valid.

- If the challenge is deemed invalid, a response is sent to the
  submitting party with a reason for rejecting the challenge.

Step 3: Notifying the Developer and Lab

- For valid challenges, the CB contacts the Developer and the lab that
  performed the evaluation, providing the reasoning for the
  determination.

Step 4: Developer Response

- The Developer has the opportunity to respond to the valid challenge.

Step 5: Final Determination

- Based on the Developer's response, the CB issues a final
  determination, which can include:

  - Rejecting the claim

  - Considering the challenge valid but already resolved

  - Considering the challenge valid but unresolved

  - Other possible outcomes as determined by the CB

This process ensures that challenges to ADA Certifications are
thoroughly reviewed and addressed, maintaining the integrity and
trustworthiness of the certification scheme.

## Developer Responses to a Challenge

A Developer may respond to the challenge as they see fit, but some
example responses to a VALID challenge are likely to include:

- A counter against the validity of the challenge.

- A patch along with an expected release date for the patch.

- A plan for resolving the challenge (if it is not specifically a
  product issue).

## CB Analysis of Developer Responses

The CB will respond to the Developer's response. Some example responses
are:

- Investigate the claim brought forth by the Developer.

- Change the initial review determination (reject the challenge).

- Determine the response resolves the reported challenge and maintains a
  valid ADA Certification during the remediation process (if remediation
  is not completed, the certification would be revoked).

- Request further changes to the product based on a review of the
  response.

## CB Revocation of a Certificate

A certification may be revoked when:

- The Developer is unable to provide an adequate resolution of the
  challenge.

- The Developer does not respond to the challenge inquiry. The CB is
  responsible for evaluating whether the Developer's response time is
  appropriate according to industry best
  practices<span class="mark">.</span>

## Challenge Constraints

Due to the nature of the Market Feedback Process, the challenge process
shall include certain safeguards to prevent abuse. Challenges that are
intentionally invalid can tie up resources across the ecosystem, from
the scheme to the labs and the Developers. While the initial review
process should filter most of these challenges, the following guidelines
will assist in limiting abuse:

- A challenge can only be submitted by an organization on an issue one
  time. Additional challenges on the same issue from that organization
  will be rejected.

- A Developer cannot challenge another Developer’s product unless said
  challenge is reported through a group within the challenging
  organization that specifically publishes security/vulnerability
  issues.

# ADA Certification Scheme Dispute and Interpretation Resolution Process

ADA shall implement a process to resolve disputes (or questions for
interpretation) that may arise with regard to the implementation or
interpretation of the scheme documentation. It is expected that over
time, Developers, labs or other interested parties may have questions
regarding the documentation and how it applies in specific situations.
In all these cases, a dispute resolution process will be followed.

ADA expects that disputing parties will use good faith and all
reasonably available resources to come to a resolution before involving
ADA. It is understood that requests for interpretation will generally
need to go directly to the ADA, in which case the parties involved shall
provide proposed resolutions along with the request for interpretation
(though ADA is not obligated to follow any proposed resolution). While
the general flow for each process is the same, there are some
differences (mainly in terms of who provides the judgment).

## Dispute Resolution Process Steps

When a request for dispute resolution is to be made, subject to the
conditions laid out, the process is as follows:

1.  The requesting party/parties send a written (email or other means
    specified by the ADA) request for resolution to the ADA.

    1.  The request shall include information about the issue being
        disputed, the reason for the dispute/request, supporting
        arguments and proposed resolution(s).

2.  Upon receipt of the request, the ADA will determine if a similar
    dispute has been raised and resolved previously.

    1.  If a similar dispute has previously been resolved, that outcome
        would be referenced here and used as the resolution.

    2.  If the dispute is new, ADA will inform all relevant parties and
        allow for comments to be made and discussed. If an agreement is
        reached here, the process ends.

3.  If the parties are still in dispute, ADA will establish a committee
    of individuals (at least 3) not directly involved with the dispute
    to judge the dispute.

    1.  Each party of the dispute shall appoint one impartial
        arbitrator, who will then appoint the third impartial arbitrator
        by agreement.

4.  The committee will use reasonable commercial efforts to seek a
    resolution as soon as practical and without undue delay. A majority
    decision will determine the resolution of the dispute.

5.  ADA will distribute the resolution to the parties involved as well
    as to the wider ecosystem. This resolution will be binding to all
    parties.

As resolutions are binding decisions that may lead to results including
sanctions such as the revocation of a certificate or loss of
authorization of an ASTL. Any sanctions to be imposed are determined as
part of the committee decision.

### Liability of Resolution Committee Members

Rulings from a resolution committee are undertaken “as is” with no
liability to the ADA, committee members, scheme staff or any related
members. As a condition to invoking the dispute resolution process, the
appellant agrees to hold the ADA, including the resolution committee
involved in rendering the decision, harmless from any and all
liabilities or damages related to the outcome of the dispute.

## Interpretation Resolution Process steps

An interpretation request is generally one where a Developer and lab
seek clarification about the requirements provided by the scheme
documentation. This type of request usually results in changes to the
documentation around the requirements. As the requirements documents may
not be changed continually, these interpretations will be published
publicly and applied manually until the requirements documentation is
updated.

1.  The requesting party/parties sends a written (email or other means
    specified by the ADA) request for resolution to the ADA. The request
    shall include information about the interpretation being requested,
    the reason for the request, supporting arguments and proposed
    resolution(s).

2.  Upon receipt of the request, the ADA will determine if a similar
    resolution has been raised and resolved previously.

    1.  If a similar request has previously been resolved, that outcome
        would be referenced here and used as the resolution.

    2.  If the request is new, ADA will review the request and determine
        the proper interpretation of the requirements.

3.  ADA will distribute the resolution to the parties involved as well
    as to the wider ecosystem.

## Matters outside the Scope of ADA Certification Dispute Resolution Process

The processes described here only related to the interpretation and
implementation of the requirements laid out in the scheme documentation.
Any dispute regarding facts, findings or recommendations of an
evaluation report itself shall be resolved between the CB, ASTL and
Developer.
