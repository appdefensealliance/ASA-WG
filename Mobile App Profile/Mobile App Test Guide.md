## Introduction

In today’s digitally-driven world, mobile applications are the backbone of countless businesses and organizations. Unfortunately, they are also prime targets for cyberattacks that threaten data confidentiality, service availability, and overall business integrity. To mitigate risks and build a secure mobile environment, a robust mobile application security standard and certification program is essential.

### Our Approach: OWASP MASVS as the Foundation

This program leverages the internationally recognized OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) as its core. The OWASP MASVS offers a comprehensive set of security assessment requirements and guidelines covering the entire mobile application development lifecycle. Building upon this base, the App Defense Alliance (ADA) focused on testable requirements with clear acceptance criteria. Further, the ADA approach emphasizes the use of automation where possible.

### Applicability

This document is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists, auditors, help desk, platform deployment, and/or DevOps personnel who plan to develop, deploy, assess, or secure mobile applications.

---

### 1.1.1 [The app securely stores sensitive data in external storage](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/controls/MASVS-STORAGE-1/)

#### Description

This control ensures that any sensitive data that is intentionally stored by the app is properly protected independently of the target location.

#### Rationale

Apps handle sensitive data coming from many sources such as the user, the backend, system services or other apps on the device and usually need to store it locally. The storage locations may be private to the app (e.g. its internal storage) or be public and therefore accessible by the user or other installed apps (e.g. public folders such as Downloads).

#### Audit

---

#### 1.1.1.1 The app shall securely store sensitive data in external storage

---

### 1.3.1 [The app uses secure authentication and authorization protocols and follows the relevant best practices](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/controls/MASVS-AUTH-1/)

#### Description

Most apps connecting to a remote endpoint require user authentication and also enforce some kind of authorization. While the enforcement of these mechanisms must be on the remote endpoint, the apps also have to ensure that it follows all the relevant best practices to ensure a secure use of the involved protocols.

#### Rationale

Authentication and authorization provide an added layer of security and help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive user data.

#### Audit

---

#### 1.3.1.1 If using OAuth 2.0 for authorization, or if using OpenID Connect for authentication, Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) shall be implemented to protect the code grant

##### Evidence

Alternatively you can present a design document that explicitly references PKCE being enabled and used.

##### Test Procedure

_AL1_

1. Review provided evidence for adherence with requirements.

_AL2_

1. Run static and dynamic analysis to ensure that PKCE is being utilized.

##### Verification

_AL1_

1. Developer evidence demonstrates that if the developer is using OAuth 2.0, PKCE is implemented to protect the code grant.

_AL2_

1. Output of the analysis shows that if the developer is using OAuth 2.0, PKCE is implemented to protect the code grant.

## 1.4 [Network](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/08-MASVS-NETWORK/)

---

### 1.4.1 [The app secures all network traffic according to the current best practices](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/controls/MASVS-NETWORK-1/)

#### Description

This control ensures that the app is in fact setting up secure connections in any situation. This is typically done by encrypting data and authenticating the remote endpoint, as TLS does. However, there are many ways for a developer to disable the platform secure defaults, or bypass them completely by using low-level APIs or third-party libraries.

## 1.8 [Privacy](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/12-MASVS-PRIVACY/)

---

### 1.8.1 [The app minimizes access to sensitive data and resources](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/controls/MASVS-PRIVACY-1/)

#### Description

Apps should only request access to the data they absolutely need for their functionality and always with informed consent from the user. This control ensures that apps practice data minimization and restricts access control.  Furthermore, apps should share data with third parties only when necessary, and this should include enforcing that third-party SDKs operate based on user consent, not by default or without it. Apps should prevent third-party SDKs from ignoring consent signals or from collecting data before consent is confirmed.  Additionally, apps should be aware of the 'supply chain' of SDKs they incorporate, ensuring that no data is unnecessarily passed down their chain of dependencies.

#### Rationale

Data minimization reduces the potential impact of data breaches or leaks.  This end-to-end responsibility for data aligns with recent SBOM regulatory requirements, making apps more accountable for their data practices.

#### Audit

---

#### 1.8.1.1 The app shall minimize access to sensitive data and resources provided by the platform

##### Evidence

AL1: Attachment of the Android manifest showing permission requests.  Provide justification for any runtime or signature permissions
