# Introduction
In today's digitally-driven world, web applications are the backbone of countless businesses and organizations. Unfortunately, they are also prime targets for cyberattacks that threaten data confidentiality, service availability, and overall business integrity. To mitigate risks and build a secure web environment, a robust web application security standard and certification program is essential. This profile is suitable for web applications that process non-pubilc data such as user data, user device data, company data, or other types of confidential information (excluding highly sensitive financial or medical PII).

**Our Approach: OWASP ASVS as the Foundation**

This program leverages the internationally recognized OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) as its core. The OWASP ASVS offers a comprehensive set of security assessment requirements and guidelines covering the entire web application development lifecycle. Building upon this base, the App Defense Alliance (ADA) focused on testable requirements with clear acceptance criteria. Further, the ADA approach emphasizes the use of automation where possible.

# Applicability
This document is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists, auditors, help desk, platform deployment, and/or DevOps personnel who plan to develop, deploy, assess, or secure solutions in the cloud.

Organizations that choose to adopt the requirements in this profile should consider their web app and web API architecture -- and any external authentication providers -- that process non-public data to define the set of web apps that are in scope for assessment.

# 1 Authentication
## 1.1 Implement strong password security measures
### Description
Applications need to have robust mechanisms in place to ensure the security of user passwords. This includes, but is not limited to, enforcing password length requirements, implementing mitigations to prevent automated attacks against authentication systems, and securely storing passwords using strong cryptographic methods.
### Rationale
Weak or compromised passwords are a common attack vector used by adversaries to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. By implementing strong password security measures, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful password-based attacks.
### Scope
- Web application
- Web and mobile APIs

---
## 1.2 Disable any default accounts for public application access interfaces
### Description
Applications should not have any pre-configured or default user accounts that can be used to access its public-facing interfaces. This includes both user and administrative accounts that come with default credentials.
### Rationale
Default accounts can be easily discovered through publicly available documentation, online forums, or other sources, making them an attractive target for attackers. If an attacker is able to gain access to a default account, they may be able to escalate their privileges and move laterally within the application or underlying infrastructure.

---
## 1.3 Out of band verifiers shall be random and not reused
### Description
Any verification codes or tokens sent through out-of-band methods (such as SMS or email) should have sufficient entropy along with a suitable expiration duration. Once a verifier has been used or has expired, it should be invalidated and a new one should be generated for each subsequent verification attempt.
### Rationale
By ensuring that out of band verifiers are securely generated and managed, the risk of an adversary intercepting and using these verifiers is significantly reduced.

# 2 Session Management
## 2.1 URLs shall not expose authentication material
### Description
Web applications must never expose authentication material, such as passwords or session cookies, within URL parameters. Authentication material should be transmitted securely, such as within HTTP headers or cookies with appropriate security flags.
### Rationale
Exposing authentication material such as session tokens in URLs significantly increases the risk of data loss and session hijacking. Attackers can easily intercept this data through browser history, network sniffing, or by tricking users into visiting malicious links.  This vulnerability undermines data protection, the security of user sessions and makes the application susceptible to unauthorized access

In cases where the application provides an API, the application shall prevent (or give developers an option) to prevent exposing sensitive information like API keys or session tokens within the URL query strings|

---
## 2.2 Implement session invalidation on logout, user request, and password change
### Description
The application must invalidate session tokens upon logout, expiration, and shall provide the option (or acts by default) to terminate other active sessions after a successful password change (including reset).
### Rationale
These features protect against unauthorized access.  Logouts and expirations prevent lingering sessions, while password-change termination deters attackers who might know an old password.  Session visibility and control let users proactively manage their account, ensuring that only authorized devices are actively associated with their profile.

---
## 2.3 Implement and secure application session tokens
### Description
When using cookie-based session tokens, the application must enforce the 'Secure' attribute (ensuring transmission only over HTTPS) and the 'HttpOnly' attribute (preventing access by client-side JavaScript).  The application prioritizes session tokens over static API keys, except where legacy systems necessitate static secrets.
### Rationale
Secure' and 'HttpOnly' mitigate risks of token interception and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, enhancing session security. Session tokens, being temporary and user-specific, offer better control and auditing compared to long-lived API secrets, making them the preferred approach for modern applications.

---
## 2.4 Protect sensitive account modifications 
### Description
Applications must enforce a complete, valid login session or require re-authentication/secondary verification prior to any sensitive actions, such as sensitive data transactions or changes to account settings.
### Rationale
This requirement prevents unauthorized access to sensitive parts of an application.  Even if an attacker partially compromises a session, re-authentication or secondary checks create an extra barrier. It helps mitigate session hijacking attempts and safeguards user data,  promoting overall account security.

# 3 Access Control
## 3.1 Implement access control mechanisms to protect data and APIs
### Description
Applications shall enforce robust access controls at a trusted service layer, ensuring data integrity and applying the principle of least privilege. This includes protecting user/data attributes, limiting user manipulation, failing securely during exceptions, defending against Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), and using strong anti-CSRF and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrative functions.
### Rationale
*Layered Defense* 
Combining URI and resource-level checks provides multiple layers of protection, enhancing security against unauthorized access.

*Fine-grained Control*
Resource-level permissions allow for precise control over individual objects or data, while URI-level controls offer broader protection of web resources.

*Flexibility*
This approach supports varying access control needs, ensuring security in diverse application architectures.

## 3.2 Implement secure OAuth integrations to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access
### Description
Applications which support OAuth integrations shall follow established security guidelines to safeguard user data and prevent unauthorized access.

### Rationale
OAuth is a widely adopted authorization framework that allows users to grant third-party applications limited access to their resources on another service without sharing their login credentials. However, if not implemented securely, OAuth can expose users to various attacks, including account compromises and information disclosure. By securely implementing OAuth integrations, the application minimizes these risks and provides users with a more secure experience.

## 3.3 Application exposed administrative interfaces shall use appropriate multi-factor authentication.
### Description
Application exposed administrative interfaces shall implement multi-factor authentication. These interfaces shall be limited to application layer functionality and must not expose the cloud infrastructure.
### Rationale
Infrastructure administrative interfaces shall never be exposed through an internet facing interface. However, there are many cases where application layer administrative tasks may need to be exposed to the internet. It is critical that these interfaces be limited in functionality and always implement multi-factor authentication to prevent attackers from compromising administrative accounts.

# 4 Communications
## 4.1 Protect data through strong cryptography 
### Description
Applications must enforce strong TLS configurations and cryptographic practices. This includes using up-to-date tools to enable only strong cipher suites (prioritizing the strongest), employing trusted TLS certificates, and ensuring secure failure modes in cryptographic modules to mitigate common cryptographic attacks.
### Rationale
Strong TLS and cipher suites ensure confidentiality and integrity of data in transit by protecting against eavesdropping and modification. Trusted TLS certificates verify authenticity and prevent adversary-in-the-middle attacks, while secure failure modes and robust cryptography deter advanced attacks exploiting weaknesses in cryptographic implementations.

# 5 Data Validation and Sanitization
## 5.1 Implement validation & input sanitation
### Description
Web applications must implement robust input validation and output encoding to defend against a wide range of injection attacks. This includes protecting against HTTP Parameter Pollution, XSS (reflected, stored, and DOM-based), SQL injection, OS command injection, file inclusion vulnerabilities, template injection, SSRF, XPath/XML injection, and unsafe use of dynamic code execution features (like eval()).
### Rationale
Robust input validation and output encoding is essential for web applications to effectively defend against multiple injection attack types. Injection attacks pose a significant risk for web applications due to their simplicity and ease of automation, enabling potential attackers to readily target vulnerable sites. By implementing secure input validation, web applications can significantly reduce the risk of attackers exploiting injection vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, manipulate data, or compromise systems.

## 5.2 Securely Handle Untrusted Files 
### Description
Web applications must safely process and manage files that originate from untrusted or unknown sources. This includes restricting uploads to expected file types and preventing direct execution of uploaded content containing HTML, JavaScript, or dynamic server-side code.
### Rationale
Files from untrusted sources may contain malicious code which could allow compromise of the application. If these files are executed directly, they can compromise the security of the web application, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other harmful actions.

## 6.2 Disable debug modes in production environments
### Description
Applications must strictly disable all debug modes before deployment into production environments.
### Rationale
Debug modes often expose sensitive information like stack traces, code internals, and environment variables. This information can aid attackers in understanding the application's structure and identifying vulnerabilities, significantly increasing the risk of targeted attacks and exploitation. Disabling debug modes removes this unnecessary risk in production.

## 6.3 The origin header shall not be used for authentication of access control decisions
### Description
The application must never rely solely on the Origin HTTP header for authentication or access control decisions.
### Rationale
The Origin header can be easily manipulated by attackers, making it an unreliable indicator of a request's true source. This could lead to unauthorized access if an application mistakenly trusts requests based on a forged  Origin header. Security mechanisms must use more robust and tamper-proof methods for authentication and authorization.

## 6.4 Protect Application from Subdomain Takeover
### Description
The application must implement safeguards to prevent subdomain takeover vulnerabilities. This includes proactive identification and removal of dangling DNS records (e.g., CNAME records pointing to decommissioned services) and regular monitoring of third-party services integrated with the application's domains.
### Rationale
Dangling DNS records and vulnerable third-party services can allow attackers to take control of subdomains. This could enable them to host malicious content on the application's domain, harming reputation and potentially leading to phishing attacks or the compromise of user data.

## 6.5 Do not log credentials or payment details
### Description
Applications must never log sensitive user data, specifically credentials (e.g., passwords, API keys) and payment details (e.g., credit card numbers, CVVs).
### Rationale
*Data Compromise Prevention*
Logging such sensitive data creates unnecessary copies that are themselves targets for attackers. If logs are compromised, critical user information is exposed, significantly increasing the impact of a breach.

*Regulatory Compliance*
Many data privacy regulations (PCI-DSS, GDPR, etc.) explicitly prohibit the storage of sensitive authentication and financial data, especially in plain text.

*Security Best Practice*
Avoiding logging sensitive information minimizes the overall attack surface and demonstrates a commitment to responsible data handling.
